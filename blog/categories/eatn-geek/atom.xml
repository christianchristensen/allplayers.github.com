<p>Bringing you and Regular Expressions closer to a first base relationship is our beloved <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesiarmes">James Armes</a>. He takes us through the easy, the hard, and the clever, with examples, explanation, and one of the shortest Eat N' Geeks we have ever sat through. This isn't to say that there isn't much clear content. It's just James is super efficient in drilling it into your brain. You will never see "Hello World" quite the same again!</p>

<p>James starts it all off with showing us both simple and complex regular expressions and then leads into telling us about the different types. Turns out, there are at least 4 different types.</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple Regular Expressions</li>
<li>POSIX Basic Regular Expressions</li>
<li>POSIX Extended Regular Expressions</li>
<li>Perl Regular Expressions</li>
</ul>


<p>James focuses mostly on Perl Regular Expressions throughout the talk and toward the end, gives a heads up on what applications and languages use what standard. He also elaborates on the basic characters that make up RegEx, advanced characters, quantifiers, and lazy quantifiers.</p>

<p>Later in the presentation, James presents on more advanced concepts such as grouping, back-referencing, look-aheads, look-behinds, and conditionals. Of all this I personally only knew the first two existed!</p>

<p>Did you know just about every modern computer language has it's own implementation of RegEx? James shows us some examples from Javascript, Perl, and PHP.</p>

<p>Lastly, he gives us a look at a couple of tools:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://aurelio.net/txt2regex/">txt2regex</a></li>
<li><a href="http://reggyapp.com/">Reggy (mac)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://regex.larsolavtorvik.com/">One of many web tools</a></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>This weeks Eat 'N Geek featured <a href="http://twitter.com/bcmiller">Bill Miller</a> - CTO of AllPlayers.com - talking about UNIX "wizardry". Some fun facts: UNIX is a fun-acronym on, during the time, Multics system. The birth of UNIX was shepharded by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie on a PDP-7 to support building their "space" game.</p>

<p>The adoption of UNIX, although initially developed at AT&amp;T Bell research labs, was greatly helped by distribution (and adoption) by universities. This is also the reason behind different distributions, such as Berkely's BSD (which also plays a heavy role in modern day Mac OSX). From the various distributions, several best practices emerged and the IEEE Posix standard came from best of class of BSD and System V.</p>

<p>Learning a few (or <em>relatively</em> few) commands and "building blocks"; the UNIX programs and their interactions provide extremely powerful toolset that is capable of solving many (if not all) problems (and most tools have proven the test of time as well).</p>

<p>Modern day open-source landscape roots itself in the culture of UNIX; Richard Stallman can be particlarly noted for his founding of the Free Software Foundation and perpetuation the culture of the availability and sharing of source code (and the vehement breakdown of any proprietary software).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/allplayers.com/presentation/d/1iqtGnBn0StccUaxVbL8FQNwGp-upDt8U1lcauY1oogo/present#slide=id.g16072346_0_174">attached slides</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/46470453">video</a> have a myriad of quick program usage and interactions.</p>

<p>Today for our weekly EatN'Geek our project manager, Brooks Burton, took us on a dive into the world of baseball and baseball statistics. Following is a reflection on his presentation as well as a summary.</p>

<p>I'm not going to dive deep into the statistics in this post. If you want to learn about those, Brooks describes them much better in his presentation than I could ever do in a post.  I highly recommend you watch the video and check out the accompanying links on the bottom.</p>

<p>I believe it's worthwhile to give a few sentences about my personal background and experiences with baseball in order to give some context to this post.  Since 2006, I have lived in Chicago in a less - than - comfortable proximity to the Chicago Cubs, Wrigely Field, and all the subsequent drunkenness and idiocy that it brings about. The obnoxious fans would always take up my parking spots, and oftentimes planning revolved around checking the Cubs schedule. Granted, I definitely enjoyed Wrigleyville in my college years, but it can get very old very fast.</p>

<p>After living in or close to Wrigleyville, better known as Chicago's Frathouse, it's fairly understandable why I have come to disrespect baseball and especially its fans.  However, after the presentation I learned that there is much more to baseball, and sports in general, than one (or at least I) can see at first glance.</p>

<p>Traditionally people around the world have cared more about sports than things they <em>should</em> care about.  And why not? Sports has the ability to bring people together across societal boundaries such as wealth, status, employment, and many others.  It's one of the few things left in our modern lives that we can truly become passionate about, break ice over, and have discussions about without worrying about political correctness.</p>

<p>In addition, baseball as a sport that's deeply rooted in American culture has its own draw.  There's something very special about going to a baseball stadium - a certain feel of history and nostalgia of the many games previously played there. In addition, each stadium has different field dimensions bringing its own subtle influence and gently helping some players play their best, while hindering the performance of others.</p>

<p>There are typically two types of fans, or rather two sides of the spectrum. There's the Viewer Fan - he watches a few games a season and simply enjoys the game and the atmosphere as it's being played. The Geek Fan, on the other hand, analyzes numbers, statistics and almost takes on the role of an amateur general manager.  Newspapers have catered to such fans as early as October 1845 by printing box scores in the sports section.  However, today we have many more stastics and advanced ways of storing them, retrieving them and interacting with them.</p>

<p>The American baseball arena today has a very unique organization structure not found in many other sports.  The MLB umbrella contains two leagues - American League and National League. These two leagues have slight deviations in their rulebooks, and which rules are used when the two leagues clash in the world series is determined by whose stadium the game is played in.</p>

<p>Below the major league teams lies an advanced minor league structure not found in any other sports. A major league team, let's take those annoying Cubs for example, will have 25 players. Below those, they will keep track of 10 or so minor league teams to see if they can move them up to the majors once they become good enough. Decisions like these are influenced by relatively advanced statistics such as WAR - Wins Above Replacement.  It's an advanced statistics calculation that answers the question "If I get rid of this player, and replace him with an average player, how many wins will I lose?".</p>

<p>Another thing that struck me and gave me quite a bit more respect for baseball was its appreciation of tradition in the face of advanced technology.  While other sports have moved to use technology to increase the accuracy of judgement calls, baseball has stayed away from that.  There are some pretty advanced technological marvels used during games. PITCHFX has cameras that will take up to 60 pictures between when the ball leaves the pitcher's hand and when the hitter hits it, determining the trajectory of the ball. After the hit, trajectory tracking systems will capture up to 6000 data points to determine how the ball flew.  However, all this data collection and advanced information technology are <strong>not</strong> used to increase the accuracy of the umpire's calls. The umpire always has the final say.  However, when the game is over the umpire can go back to look at the information to learn from his mistakes.</p>

<p>Baseball is a very interesting game wrapped in tradition and nostalgia, refusing to move away from the old, yet managing to adapt to the new in unique ways.  I know I'll be going to see a baseball game this summer (I still dislike the Cubs, but the Sox I'll definitely go and see).  And I know as I watch the ball fly from player to player on the field that while there's a ton of tracking information being collected, at the end of the day, the game is played no different than it was 100 years ago.  And there's definitely something cool about that.</p>

<p>Melissa McKay, wife of the CEO of AllPlayers.com, Jason McKay, indulges us with her hobby of International Security. Her talk is specifically about the content that was released on the Wikileaks website and a brief overview of those involved as well as some known specifics about Government Security Protocol when it comes to technology.</p>

<p>I'd hate to spoil the video with a long drawn out explanation of what she went over. Definitely worth watching!</p>
