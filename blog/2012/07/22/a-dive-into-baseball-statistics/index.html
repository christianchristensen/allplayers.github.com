<p>Today for our weekly EatN&#8217;Geek our project manager, Brooks Burton, took us on a dive into the world of baseball and baseball statistics. Following is a reflection on his presentation as well as a summary.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to dive deep into the statistics in this post. If you want to learn about those, Brooks describes them much better in his presentation than I could ever do in a post.  I highly recommend you watch the video and check out the accompanying links on the bottom.</p>

<p>I believe it&#8217;s worthwhile to give a few sentences about my personal background and experiences with baseball in order to give some context to this post.  Since 2006, I have lived in Chicago in a less - than - comfortable proximity to the Chicago Cubs, Wrigely Field, and all the subsequent drunkenness and idiocy that it brings about. The obnoxious fans would always take up my parking spots, and oftentimes planning revolved around checking the Cubs schedule. Granted, I definitely enjoyed Wrigleyville in my college years, but it can get very old very fast.</p>

<p>After living in or close to Wrigleyville, better known as Chicago&#8217;s Frathouse, it&#8217;s fairly understandable why I have come to disrespect baseball and especially its fans.  However, after the presentation I learned that there is much more to baseball, and sports in general, than one (or at least I) can see at first glance.</p>

<p>Traditionally people around the world have cared more about sports than things they <em>should</em> care about.  And why not? Sports has the ability to bring people together across societal boundaries such as wealth, status, employment, and many others.  It&#8217;s one of the few things left in our modern lives that we can truly become passionate about, break ice over, and have discussions about without worrying about political correctness.</p>

<p>In addition, baseball as a sport that&#8217;s deeply rooted in American culture has its own draw.  There&#8217;s something very special about going to a baseball stadium - a certain feel of history and nostalgia of the many games previously played there. In addition, each stadium has different field dimensions bringing its own subtle influence and gently helping some players play their best, while hindering the performance of others.</p>

<p>There are typically two types of fans, or rather two sides of the spectrum. There&#8217;s the Viewer Fan - he watches a few games a season and simply enjoys the game and the atmosphere as it&#8217;s being played. The Geek Fan, on the other hand, analyzes numbers, statistics and almost takes on the role of an amateur general manager.  Newspapers have catered to such fans as early as October 1845 by printing box scores in the sports section.  However, today we have many more stastics and advanced ways of storing them, retrieving them and interacting with them.</p>

<p>The American baseball arena today has a very unique organization structure not found in many other sports.  The MLB umbrella contains two leagues - American League and National League. These two leagues have slight deviations in their rulebooks, and which rules are used when the two leagues clash in the world series is determined by whose stadium the game is played in.</p>

<p>Below the major league teams lies an advanced minor league structure not found in any other sports. A major league team, let&#8217;s take those annoying Cubs for example, will have 25 players. Below those, they will keep track of 10 or so minor league teams to see if they can move them up to the majors once they become good enough. Decisions like these are influenced by relatively advanced statistics such as WAR - Wins Above Replacement.  It&#8217;s an advanced statistics calculation that answers the question &#8220;If I get rid of this player, and replace him with an average player, how many wins will I lose?&#8221;.</p>

<p>Another thing that struck me and gave me quite a bit more respect for baseball was its appreciation of tradition in the face of advanced technology.  While other sports have moved to use technology to increase the accuracy of judgement calls, baseball has stayed away from that.  There are some pretty advanced technological marvels used during games. PITCHFX has cameras that will take up to 60 pictures between when the ball leaves the pitcher&#8217;s hand and when the hitter hits it, determining the trajectory of the ball. After the hit, trajectory tracking systems will capture up to 6000 data points to determine how the ball flew.  However, all this data collection and advanced information technology are <strong>not</strong> used to increase the accuracy of the umpire&#8217;s calls. The umpire always has the final say.  However, when the game is over the umpire can go back to look at the information to learn from his mistakes.</p>

<p>Baseball is a very interesting game wrapped in tradition and nostalgia, refusing to move away from the old, yet managing to adapt to the new in unique ways.  I know I&#8217;ll be going to see a baseball game this summer (I still dislike the Cubs, but the Sox I&#8217;ll definitely go and see).  And I know as I watch the ball fly from player to player on the field that while there&#8217;s a ton of tracking information being collected, at the end of the day, the game is played no different than it was 100 years ago.  And there&#8217;s definitely something cool about that.</p>
